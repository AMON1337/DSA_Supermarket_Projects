# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) - Supermarket Projects

This project was developed as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms course, aiming to apply the learned concepts by creating a supermarket simulation. The project is divided into two distinct parts:

## Technical Details

**Project content in Portuguese, required for University!**

### Language
- C++

### Tools and Technologies
- Microsoft Visual Studio

### Project Structure
The project is meticulously organized into two primary sections:

1. **Supermarket with Structs and Dynamic Arrays**
   - **Source code and related files:** `SuperEDA_Structs_Arrays`
   - **Data structures used:** Structs, Dynamic Arrays

2. **Supermarket with Linked Lists and Binary Trees**
   - **Source code and related files:** `SuperEDA_2_LinkedLists_BinaryTrees`
   - **Data structures used:** Linked Lists, Binary Trees

### Objective
Developed within the framework of the Data Structures and Algorithms course, this project serves to apply the concepts assimilated throughout the discipline. The supermarket simulation leverages a spectrum of data structures, including Structs, Dynamic Arrays, Linked Lists, and Binary Trees. The amalgamation of both approaches affords a holistic perspective on the diverse techniques employed in crafting the supermarket simulation.

## Part 1: Supermarket with Structs and Dynamic Arrays

In the inaugural section of the project, the supermarket was simulated using "Structs" to encapsulate essential elements and "Dynamic Arrays" for dynamic memory management.

The source code and related files for this segment of the project are housed in the `SuperEDA_Structs_Arrays` folder.

## Part 2: Supermarket with Linked Lists and Binary Trees

The subsequent section witnessed an augmentation of the supermarket simulation by integrating advanced data structures. "Linked Lists" were introduced for dynamic data manipulation, while "Binary Trees" were employed to optimize specific operations.

The relevant files for this section are located in the `SuperEDA_2_LinkedLists_BinaryTrees` folder.

## Consolidated Project

Both sections have seamlessly converged into a unified repository, offering a panoramic view of the diverse approaches employed. To delve into the consolidated code, refer to the following folders:

- **SuperEDA_2_LinkedLists_BinaryTrees:** Encompasses the implementation using Linked Lists and Binary Trees.
- **SuperEDA_Structs_Arrays:** Encompasses the initial implementation using Structs and Dynamic Arrays.

## How to Open the Project
